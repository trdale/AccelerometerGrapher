This android app was designed to plot the accelerometer data from your android to device to a webserver backend in real time.

It plots the data x, y, and z into a graph using smoothie.js. The backend was originally a AWS server that is no longer running, but the code could easily be modified inside the android code (mainactivity.java file) to update where the data should be being sent.

This project was an extension of learning sockets, node.js, as well as my first android application.
